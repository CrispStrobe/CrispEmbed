# CrispEmbed — Technical Learnings

## ggml GQA broadcasting (critical for decoder models)

`ggml_mul_mat` natively broadcasts ne[2] when `b->ne[2] % a->ne[2] == 0`.
For GQA (16 Q heads, 8 KV heads): **do NOT explicitly repeat K/V**.
`ggml_repeat` tiles `[h0..h7, h0..h7]` which is WRONG for GQA (should
be `[h0,h0,h1,h1,...]`). Just let mul_mat broadcast — it handles the
interleaved head mapping correctly internally.

Also: after attention, reshape to `q_dim = n_heads × head_dim` (NOT
`hidden_size`). For GQA models, q_dim ≠ hidden_size (e.g. 2048 vs 1024).

## BERT post-LN vs pre-LN

BERT uses post-LayerNorm: `attn → residual_add → LN → FFN → residual_add → LN`.
Many newer models (GPT, LLaMA) use pre-LN. Getting this wrong produces
output that looks plausible but has completely wrong magnitudes.

## RoPE application order

For Qwen3: RoPE is applied on `[head_dim, n_heads, T]` tensor (BEFORE
permute to `[head_dim, T, n_heads]`). `ggml_rope_ext` requires ne[2]=T
(the position dimension), which matches the unpermuted layout. Applying
RoPE after permute crashes with dimension mismatch.

At position 0, RoPE is identity (cos=1, sin=0), so position-0 values
match regardless of whether RoPE is applied. Debug with position > 0
to verify RoPE correctness.

## Tokenizer types for embedding models

| Model family | Tokenizer | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| BERT/MiniLM/GTE | WordPiece | Greedy longest-match with ## prefix |
| XLM-RoBERTa/E5/Arctic | SentencePiece | Bigram merge with scores (≈Viterbi) |
| Qwen3/Octen/F2LLM | GPT-2 BPE | core_bpe byte-level BPE with merges |

Auto-detected from GGUF metadata: `tokenizer.ggml.type` (0=WP, 1=BPE, 2=SP)
or heuristic (vocab > 100K → SentencePiece).

## Per-op debugging methodology

Same as CrispASR: dump every intermediate tensor from BOTH HF reference
and our ggml graph, compare at each stage. The divergence point identifies
the exact broken operation. For Octen-Embedding-0.6B, this revealed:
- input_ln: MATCH
- q_proj/k_proj: MATCH
- q_norm/k_norm: MATCH
- o_proj: MISMATCH → GQA repeat was wrong
- Fix: remove ggml_repeat, let mul_mat broadcast → MATCH
