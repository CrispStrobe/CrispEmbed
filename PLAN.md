# CrispEmbed active plan —29 October2026 wrap-up

Start with [the executable handoff](docs/handoff-2026-10-29.md). It gives exact
sources, job states, inputs, commands, limits and acceptance gates. Completed
results and superseded task claims are in [HISTORY](HISTORY.md); measurements
are in [PERFORMANCE](PERFORMANCE.md). The full previous plan is preserved in
[the dated archive](HISTORY.md#archived-roadmap-snapshot-29-october2026).

This is an open roadmap. No new portfolio release, default flip or quantized
qualification is claimed. Development VERSION is0.17.14; the application stays
on immutable0.17.12. Do not bump versions for this documentation handoff.

## Immediate executable order

Choose one bounded lane. The source table and current remote states in the
handoff take precedence over historical commands.

1. Inspect the two already queued jobs: Unlimited40868634374 and
   Ultra40871150002. Verify exact source/attempt and collect small reports after
   completion; do not duplicate them. Keep models/raw arrays remote.
2. Repair the weight-free WASM component-profile guard after40867038915 rejects
   `Actual component rounding flags differ`. Save/review the actual compile
   inventory before asserting exact target counts/flags. Preserve ff3 and the
   full norm negative. No model run until component/browser controls pass.
3. Independently review MoE real-router source81fa4e26, then execute its
   component-only replay using exact-v4 attached captures. No whole-model or
   original forward. Require own-byte controls before cross-input conclusions.
4. Implement Gemma's frozen live-snapshot/768-wide-adapter design0ee3fb674.
   It is **not executable**. Review the implementation, then activate only one
   18-ID probe/three native calls. Review actual live/late/pooled evidence before
   separately declaring any full145-stage/typed/Q4 retry.
5. Independently review Josev imatrix source208fbefe, register its workflow, then
   execute its fixed40-prefill development panel on a host satisfying14GiB
   RAM/64GiB disk. Do not silently lower its resource/source guards for Kaggle.
6. Complete the remaining precision/task/client gates below, then integrate
   reviewed opt-ins and qualify final runtime/assets/consumers. Each new model
   or arithmetic source needs its own reference/quality/consumer evidence.

## Required Q8_0 and Q4_K coverage for new permissive models (29 October)

Use actual `crispembed-quantize`, original Python/ONNX dumps and actual
`crispembed-diff`. Keep critical tensor types/payload hashes, axes, compiler/
backend provenance, absolute/RMS errors, magnitudes, cosine and final task
outputs. Numerical and task verdicts are distinct; preserve negative flags.
[Measured critical-tensor evidence](docs/critical-tensor-precision-20261029.md)
explains why a generic exemption list is insufficient.

| Front | Current boundary | Remaining work and completion gate |
|---|---|---|
| Josev-2B |F32 composition227 stages/four typed requests is established; protected/single-projection quantization negatives are retained. Final-pair Q8 passes a limited decision screen but75 strict stages/full serialization remain negative. |Execute reviewed calibrated/uncalibrated final-pair Q4 experiment; keep292 critical F32/148 F16/2 Q4 and exact uncalibrated model continuity. Do not select/tune on NEW20. A separately declared independent task panel, actual six-client/public/error/recovery checks and immutable HF readback remain before publication. Q8 and Q4 qualification are both open. |
| MoEdern1.5M |Actual F32 capture localizes one near-boundary expert change; router weights already F32. Component-only replay source is ready, execution unreviewed. |Separate same-input operator rounding from upstream input effects; preserve exact-tie guards and all original matrices. Only then declare a gated correction, original-bound full5483-vector/300-query replay and Q8/Q4 retrieval/client panels. Keep explicit query/document roles and late-interaction semantics. |
| MoEdern27M/115M |Original token checks complete but exact-router-tie failures prevent full reference completion. Authored Q8/top-k tests are component evidence only. |Use source-backed routing semantics and bounded failed-row attribution before separately frozen original/full native controls. Preserve115M dilated-conv behavior. Validate actual20/20/52 padded Q4 and protected Q8 tensors, full retrieval and all public consumers; no component-to-model promotion. |
| UltraBERT |Frozen5483-row F32 control/300 rankings pass. First conservative Q4 shard686 rows completes with strict vector negatives. |Review queued seven-shard/full300-query aggregate on the SAME candidate; no original/F32/quantizer repeat. Keep .001 task-degradation/.99 top-one gates and strict vector flags separately. Q8 needs explicit metadata/type admission; standard-header normalization, public clients, independent activation and publication/readback remain open. Public pairs/F16/long-context/GPU/performance are distinct follow-ups. |
| Unlimited-OCR-2 |Exact retained540-file/model structure passes; first numerical attempt stopped at an isolated import before forwards. |Review queued repaired last1 reuse panel:16 F16 controls before12 Q4 calls/16 projections. Preserve decoded body/box gates and exact source. Last4/all11 and protected Q8 need separately declared panels. Quantized task/public clients/publication remain unqualified. |
| MiniCPM-OCR |All30 decoded cases exact; vision130/180 pass,50 fail;96 crop parts unmapped. Q4 protects vision while generic Q8 quantizes it. |Declare decoder-only Q8 on the SAME186 decoder matrices; keep593 source-model exclusions byte-exact. Independently attribute earliest F32 vision differences with same inputs/weights and document unmapped crop limits. Preserve original23 plus added7 outputs; qualify all five cases/intermediates/clients before publication. No original corpus recapture or generic quantizer default change. |
| LFM2.5 masked230M |Published Q8/Q4/calibrated/mixed profiles exist, but mixed330 still changes one masked prediction. |Reuse immutable original/same-weight references; isolate remaining prediction-sensitive groups. Preserve attention/ShortConv/FFN-down high precision supported by actual ablations. Freeze independent task inputs before selection; extend quantized/GPU/client evidence separately. Do not confuse this with the350M retrieval model. |
| Typed EmbeddingGemma |Q8 approximation published; first new Q4 worker stops at F32 saved-stage/adapter failures. All five pooled F32 embeddings pass. |Implement/review design-only repair, three-call first probe, then separately activate full145/eight-typed/30-bank F32 barrier before unchanged broad/protected-input Q4 recipes. Q8 current-source replay and Rust/Dart model-backed paths remain open; old wrapper helpers hardcode F32. Independent task/GPU/performance/publication gates remain separate. |
| OvisOCR2/OvisOCR3 |Ovis2 F16 is published/consumer-verified. All existing Q8/plain/calibrated/mixed Q4 candidates are rejected. Ovis3 faithfully matches an original capped/poor-quality page. |Keep Ovis2 F16/alias; new precision selection needs fresh development protocol after completed same-weight attribution. Ovis3 needs a separate original-first task/evaluation protocol before quantization, alias or publication. Never raise caps/change prompt/gold to pass old quality gates. |

For each candidate: authenticate all declared inputs before model use, preserve
ordinary/observer/repeat and rejection/recovery controls, compare earliest actual
intermediates, and evaluate complete decoded/typed outputs or retrieval rankings.
Only a separately qualified candidate proceeds to all public surfaces, immutable
HF upload/empty-cache readback, registry pins and consumers. Stored files alone
are not qualification. Calibration is development-only; never invent reference
activations or waive historical budgets.

## Active Ovis completion sequence

Draft [PR89](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispEmbed/pull/89) holds integration
`8da6636b35d33623e143ae34120c09fb9878a460`. Its frozen test-source formatting
failure must be repaired **only in a new integration closure**, preserving every
producer's source/receipts. Merge carefully: old branches can delete unrelated
registered workflows/evidence; review all deletions against current main.

After final code decisions, declare a new complete source closure. Require
original-bound Ovis fourteen-arm plus first-F16 eleven-case replay on BOTH gates,
all frozen IDs/text/EOS/caps/confidences, appropriate public interfaces and the
full required CI. Then create fresh native/WASM assets and verify actual Linux,
Apple, Windows, Android/browser consumers, hashes, baseline CPU portability,
installed loads and aggregation. Only then use the version/release procedure,
immutable model aliases and a separate downstream app-pin upgrade.

The old frozen full-source guards intentionally reject a changed runtime. Do
not weaken them, relabel another source or infer asset qualification from CI.

## Ovis 2048-patch numerical attribution — before broader input claims

Default1024 stays. Frozen/1024/1200 pass14 arms;2048 has six composed final-norm
failures despite exact text/EOS. Reuse original embeddings and retained inputs;
isolate the first divergent position/interpolation/norm boundary with actual
source-fed operators before any broader-page claim. Preserve the four opt-in
large-image gates and existing strict/calibrated budgets.

## Other open numerical, performance and consumer lanes

Each row requires a new bounded protocol, frozen inputs, original/reference
comparison, final-output checks and actual hosted evidence before adoption.
Detailed prior acceptance clauses remain in the archived roadmap/model docs.

| Lane | First bounded action | Gate/dependency |
|---|---|---|
| WASM layer3 |Complete corrected one-sentence live operand capture; use actual13 norms/23 layer3 boundaries and same-input replays. |Preserve full norm/stored-F32/rounding negatives and default-off gates.208 local/196 natural comparisons and native/old-WASM byte anchors stay distinct. No full ten-case retry or arithmetic change before attribution. |
| LightOnOCR-3-0.8B |Use retained book isolation to investigate upstream vision, with one fixed input/source-fed replay. |Exact independent-document text retains numerical debt; all quantized receipt/book recipes remain rejected. No publication/default from literal EOS or table-cell equality. |
| OCR real pages/benchmarks |Freeze licensed annotations/reading order and consistent timing spans for common pages across supported engines. |Report CER/WER, boxes, order, EOS/caps, confidence and paired latency/RSS; upstream OCRBench/OmniDocBench/olmOCRBench scores are not reproduced merely by integration. Tau-squared is an agent benchmark. Preserve Mini's one and Unlimited's19 real-page token mismatches. |
| Tesseract/Fraktur |Freeze exact line/crop geometry and compare official recoder/decoder/dictionary/spacing outputs. |Keep multi-code recoding/default DBNet and beam alternatives. Certainty, line counts, CER/WER and crop batching must be measured independently. |
| PP-OCRv6/orientation/EasyOCR |Reproduce one detector geometry/readback or SE/depthwise outlier; freeze word boxes/order for structured LayoutLM inputs. |Artifact-backed sizes, original/native crops/recognition and actual device evidence; retain CPU fallback and provenance. |
| PreprocessingT2/O10, batchingT3–T6 |Choose one cleanup/dewarp/binarization/resize/depthwise/crop-batch change against annotated pages. |Recognition/geometry quality first; identical input/output timing spans. Do not select preprocessing from synthetic-reference similarity alone. |
| Layout/TableFormerT16 |Freeze document structure/reading-order gold, then profile one GPU value projection/hot spot. |Actual decoded structure/boxes and device execution, not allocation backend alone. |
| Qwen/formula/backendR3/R6/O3/O7 |Profile one measured decoder/encoder/GEMM/thread-propagation or residency hot spot. |Preserve CPU/serial/parallel alternatives; actual F32/cache/decoded and paired memory/timing controls. Graph setup was negligible in old profiling; do not optimize it by analogy. |
| Ovis decoder cache/F2 |Freeze representative same-host cold/warm initialization, repeated recognition and one/two-context latency/RSS. |256MiB cache remains off after only0.797% warm median gain/increased RSS. Full970MiB head remains fallback. Metal cap adoption needs actual device evidence. |
| Pipeline cache identity |Start with legacy engine20 and two distinct model paths. |Force second-model/rejection/recovery proof before an engine-specific key fix; preserve completed Ovis stage-owned path identity. |
| F3–F6/VLM frontends |Separately scope CLI thread default, SmolDocling vision scheduling, DeepSeek-OCR2 crop/F16-KV or Qwen3-VL/jina resize/tiling contracts. |Current source/licensing, original input geometry and final outputs/performance; do not port caches or defaults family-wide. |
| Backend bring-up |Use actual CUDA/Metal/Vulkan hardware for a single proven compute/scheduling gap. |Verify numerical/decoded quality, actual compute placement, residency and memory; host allocation is insufficient. |
| E4/encoder ecosystem |Freeze German/Japanese representative quality inputs; reconcile feature matrix/Nomic MoE opt-in independently. |MTEB/JMTEB task quality, actual representative latency and consumer compatibility; byte equality alone is not a speed claim. |
| Restoration/OMR |Validate Q8 ESRGAN/SCUNet or one eligible notation/vocabulary candidate under its own original blueprint. |Do not publish known bad ESRGAN Q4. Transcoda remains outside permissive queue; oemer remains reference-only. Preserve completed TrOMR/Flova evidence. |
| Coverage/T9/F10/SAM |Audit one native output/control gap; coordinate sibling changes explicitly. |No silent CrispASR changes. SAM stays with its existing owner; leave unrelated work intact. |

## Permissive OCR queue

Audit actual code, checkpoint, base and dependencies first: MIT/Apache/BSD or
similarly permissive terms only. For each model use the contribution checklist:
converter/full tensor census; actual Python/ONNX blueprint and intermediate
reference; gated native math with earliest-stage/final-output comparison; C ABI,
orchestrator, CLI/server, Python/Rust/Dart; actual Q8/Q4_K task qualification;
immutable upload/readback, registry hashes and real consumers.

Proceed smallest applicable backend first after the current closure:

1. Xiaomi-OCR-0: source/base audit and exact Qwen3.5-0.8B frontend/native reuse;
   community GGUF quality is unverified.
2. LightOnOCR-3-1B: verify exact official preprocessing, tokenizer, transcription
   and grounding against the existing LightOn backend.
3. TeleOCR: audit base/NaviDC provenance and structured output before reusing
   Qwen2.5-VL.
4. LightOnOCR-3-4B and Qwen3.5-9B: separate long-page/memory/GPU reference and
   task protocols after small dense-model parity.
5. Qwen3.6-27B: dense64-layer config and resource-qualified long-context port.
6. Infinity-Parser2-Pro: MoE40-layer/256-expert implementation and total-parameter
   storage; active parameters do not determine GGUF size.

Indra is public-code-analysis-only under the selected scope. Chandra-OCR-2,
MinerU2.5-Pro, Hunyuan-OCR, dots.ocr and other restricted candidates remain
outside this lane. Do not infer weight permission from a public repository.

## Surya OCR 2.5 (owner-requested; restricted OpenRAIL-M weights)

Qwen3.5 VLM with a character-level WordLevel tokenizer; outside the permissive
queue, registry only behind licence acceptance like `surya-det`. Contract, gaps
and staged plan: [docs/surya-ocr-2.5.md](docs/surya-ocr-2.5.md). Next: review the
hosted weight-free metadata run (`surya25-metadata.yml`), pin the revision, then
freeze an original HF reference before any converter profile or native gate.

## Issue71, packaging and downstream delivery

- Issue71 MI-GAN: fixed256 CPU/F32 prototype and494/eight-fixture audit are
  complete. Next freeze licensed real subtitle/scene images and masks, perceptual/
  seam criteria; then separately implement C ABI/orchestrator/CLI/server/bindings,
  registry, error/recovery and consumers. Video/motion/flicker and text-derived
  masks need their own gold. Other sizes/F16/quantization/backends/batching remain
  separate. LaMa is held on checkpoint terms/FFT semantics. Keep issue71 open.
- Source/wheel success is not release qualification. Require fresh portable
  native/WASM producers, installed bundle/ABI/platform consumers and full
  aggregation for the final source, then update release metadata coherently.
- PosFormer/handwriting: retain7/50 original versus0/50 candidate, old legacy=0
  and full-checkpoint/sequence parity debt. No new training or quality claim
  without licensed inputs and an original blueprint.
- CrispMath stays immutable0.17.12. After compatible qualified assets exist,
  separately update its pin/actual consumers. Physical-device/accessibility/
  localization/narrow-layout and App Review/store work remain consumer tasks;
  cloud/collaboration are optional separate decisions.
- CrispSorter: use the actual Rust/Tauri/Svelte extractor/config/selector paths,
  orchestrator stage21 for qualified Ovis2; stage22/Ovis3 remains unqualified.
  Require selected-library identity, fresh model hashes, outputs/confidence,
  prompt/cap rejection and fallback behavior. Do not reuse legacy VLM number space.
