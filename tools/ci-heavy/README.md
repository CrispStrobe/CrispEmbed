# tools/ci-heavy: heavy CPU jobs on GitHub Actions

Scripts here run on GitHub-hosted runners through `.github/workflows/heavy-cpu.yml`,
triggered by hand. Use this for CPU work that used to go to Kaggle: Python reference
dumps, parity diffs, ASR roundtrips, and download → convert → quantize → upload.

| Runner | CPU / RAM | Disk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ubuntu-latest` (default) | 4 vCPU / 16 GB | ~14 GB free on `/`, plus the `/mnt` scratch disk; the workflow also deletes unused toolchains | fp32 references up to ~3B params |
| `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | 4 vCPU / 16 GB | as above, minus `/mnt` | aarch64 numerics |
| `macos-14` | 3 vCPU (M1) / 7 GB | ~14 GB | Metal |

Runners are free for public repos and a job can run up to 6 h.

**Keep on Kaggle** (`tools/kaggle/`) only what needs a real GPU: CUDA or Vulkan
speed and parity on hardware, and PyTorch on CUDA. Kaggle allows one account per
person, with GPU sessions used for GPU work.

## Running a job

```bash
gh workflow run heavy-cpu.yml -f script=tools/ci-heavy/qwen3vl_ref_ocr.py \
    -f pip="torch torchvision transformers>=4.57 accelerate pillow"
gh run watch "$(gh run list -w heavy-cpu.yml -L 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')"
# Retrieve only needed small reports/images from the run artifact.
```

## Independent case lanes

By default, runs of the same script share a concurrency group. For immutable
reference audits with separate runner scratch space, unique run artifacts and
no shared publication writes, `-f isolated_lane=qwen35-quality-q8-two-column-page`
selects an independent group. Reuse the same model/recipe/case key for retries;
keep the field empty for jobs that share mutable outputs or external writes.
This permits independent hosted cases to overlap without changing default script
serialization. Record the exact source commit and input recipe for every run.

[GitHub concurrency documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/control-workflow-concurrency)
describes the default single pending slot: another pending dispatch in the same
group replaces the earlier pending run. Inspect actual run states rather than
assuming a batch of dispatches is retained. Keep large artifacts remote and
retrieve only the reports/images needed for review.

## Script contract

- **`$HEAVY_OUT`**: write results here. The whole directory becomes the run's artifact, kept for 14 days.
- **`$HEAVY_SCRATCH`**: large scratch space for models, builds and caches. Not uploaded. `HF_HOME` points inside it.
- **`$HF_TOKEN`**: the repository secret (fine-grained, CI-scoped); may be empty.
- **`$HEAVY_OUT/summary.md`**: if present, appended to the run's summary page.
- **Exit code**: non-zero when the check fails, so the run shows red. A readout that prints the same thing whether it passed or failed isn't a check.
- **Paths**: the workflow only accepts `.py` / `.sh` files under `tools/ci-heavy/`.
- **Porting a Kaggle kernel**: replace `/kaggle/working` with `$HEAVY_OUT` and `/kaggle/input/...` with a download into `$HEAVY_SCRATCH`. Drop the GPU and ccache datasets.
